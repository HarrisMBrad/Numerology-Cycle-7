# 🚧 Current Development Focus: April 2025  

We are actively building the core symbolic runtime system for **Numerology-Cycle-7**.  

**Key priorities for this phase:**

- 📦 Establish a modular **Phase Kernel** for each numerology value (1-9)
- 🔄 Implement the **MindState Memory Layer** to track daily cycles and outcomes
- 🧠 Formalize `evaluateHarmony()` method for harmony score evaluation
- 📖 Create a **mindStateCycle_418.js** checkpoint as part of our recursion log
- 🔄 Push to `dev-branch` and manage PRs under structured numerology-based task codes (e.g. `TASK-418`)

If you’re seeing this, you’re witnessing this framework being born in real-time. Pull requests, ideas, and pattern collaborations are welcome.

## 📌 Repository Goals

- **Track daily human and project cycles via numerology**
- **Model mindstate recursions for decision support**
- **Map collective consciousness patterns**
- **Offer a developer-first symbolic OS architecture**
