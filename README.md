# 🚧 Current Development Focus: April 2025

We are actively building the core symbolic runtime system for **Numerology-Cycle-7**.

**Key priorities for this phase:**

- 📦 Build a modular **Phase Kernel** for numerology values **1–9**
- 🔄 Implement a **MindState Memory Layer** to track daily cycles and outcomes
- 🧠 Develop `evaluateHarmony()` for harmony score evaluations
- 📖 Create a recursive checkpoint log via `mindStateCycle_418.js`
- 🔄 Push to `dev-branch` and manage pull requests under structured numerology task codes (e.g., `TASK-418`)

If you’re reading this — you’re witnessing this symbolic framework being born in real-time. Pull requests, ideas, and pattern contributions are welcome.

## 📌 Repository Goals

- Track daily human and project cycles through numerology
- Model mindstate recursions for decision support
- Map patterns in collective consciousness data
- Build a developer-first symbolic operating system architecture
